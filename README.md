# A simple Pomodoro timer

## How to run
1. Clone repo locally
1. `cargo r -- -t "task 1" "task 2" "task 3"`
or
1. Run `cargo install --path .` from inside the root of the repo
1. Run `pomors -t "task 1" "task 2" "task 3"`


## Cool new feature ideas
* Add a time spent on each task, which updates while the task is selected
* A text file based database, ie save [task_name, completion_state, time_elapsed]
